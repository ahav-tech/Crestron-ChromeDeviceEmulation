# Crestron-ChromeDeviceEmulation #

## Notes ##

A manual export with the portion of my Windows Chrome configuration that has the Crestron touchpanel emulation details (from Crestron HTML5 microsite). I do not know the User Agent String for the panels so I left this blank for now.

You could try copying these into your configuration if you are game...

There are two files:

- CrestronTsxEmulation.txt; contains the text as directly copied from my preferences file
- CrestronTsxEmulation-Separated.txt; the same text, but separated out into individual devices

I'm not sure why there are two blank devices in my configuration but they don't show up in Chrome. 

I don't have any devices to test with so I don't know if they match at all; I am just going off the Crestron HTML5 User Interface website @ <https://www.crestron.com/developer>.
